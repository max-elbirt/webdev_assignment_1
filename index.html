    <h3>"Iron Gustav" by Hans Fallada</h3></a>
<br>

<br>
<p>"Iron Gustav" tells the story of a german patriarch and his family before, during and after the
first world war. The war plunges his life and family into chaos, and changes everything Gustav knew about his country,
    and his understanding of happiness, parenthood and true misery and hardship.</p>
<p>I like "Iron Gustav" because of its overall anti-war message, conveying to the reader the terrible hardships of war
on the battlefield and at home.</p>
<p><u>A quote from the book:</u><br>
<q><span style="font-style: italic">You only want to tyrannise, you’re only happy when we’re all trembling before you. You’re just like your Kaiser.
    He who doesn’t obey is shot down…</span></q></p>

<h3>Zichron Yaakov</h3>
<img src="/graphics/Zichron-yaakov_Israel_Konstantnin_Shutterstock.jpg" alt="an image of the town Zichron Yaakov" title="an image of the town Zichron Yaakov">
<p>Zichron Yaakov is one of the first modern settlements in Israel. The town was founded in 1882, and in the present day
    is known for it's views, fresh air and vineyards.</p>
<p>As someone who was raised in Tel Aviv (a comparatively major city) I enjoyed the feeling of a small town atop a
    mountain and somewhat removed from the rest of the world. </p>
